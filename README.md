# blender_wavepacket
Python script to create an animated propagating wavepacket in Blender. Developed in Blender 2.90.

The animation is based on keyframing the vertex coordinates of a mesh by a Python script. Warning: the resulting .blend file can become relatively large, depending on the resolution of the mesh.
